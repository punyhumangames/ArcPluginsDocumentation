## The one that updates to 5.2

* Added engine support for UE5.2
* Fragment Tags are now Replicated by default
* Deprecated all blueprints inside the plugin, and migrated them over to the example project.  Please view [the deprecations page](./deprecations) for more information
* Fixed stacking two item stacks across different inventories deleting both items
* Fixed incorrect stacking logic computing the wrong stack sizes and swapping them after adjusting their stack sizes

* BREAKING CHANGE: `UArcInventoryProcessor::ProcessItemSlotSwap` now returns a bool instead of a `EArcSourceItemState`.  `ProcessItemSlotSwap` should return true if the function has handled item swapping, false if it did not handle it.  All processors are given the opportunity now to process the swap, regardless of if another processor has modified it.
